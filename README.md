# My-AI
Hello everyone!! I want to make AI one by one like only you.
I would like to create an application that allows me to create my own personal Ai. 
For example, I want to be able to give the AI a name that I decide, and have it grow as I grow.
For example, you can give the AI a name you decide, or it can grow as you grow, or it can give you the best answer for you.
I would also like to create an AI that evolves with the type of industry it is in, for companies.

Self Introduction
I am a 19-year-old student who is currently planning to go to university abroad (UCLA). My programming experience includes HTML&CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL (just a little bit), and Pyhton (currently studying)! I plan to mainly use Python to create AI, but if you have any other language recommendations, please let me know!

I need your great ideas and skills! Any help anyone can give me would be great!
Let's make your own AI with me!
